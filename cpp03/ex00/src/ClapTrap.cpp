// When ClapTrap attacks, it causes its target to lose <attack damage> hit points. When ClapTrap repairs itself, it regains <amount> hit points. Attacking and repairing each cost 1 energy point. Of course, ClapTrap canâ€™t do anything if it has no hit points or energy points left. However, since these exercises serve as an introduction, the ClapTrap instances should not interact directly with one another, and the parameters will not refer to another instance of ClapTrap.

// In all of these member functions, you need to print a message to describe what happens. For example, the attack() function may display something like (of course, without the angle brackets): ClapTrap <name> attacks <target>, causing <damage> points of damage! The constructors and destructor must also display a message, so your peer-evaluators can easily see that they have been called.

// Implement and turn in your own tests to ensure your code works as expected
